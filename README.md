This app visualizes the steps of the heap sort alogrithm.

You can choose the tree size and randomize items then click the heap sort button and the app will start sorting.

![Heap Sort Visualization. Note: the animation looks slow because of the gif file, you can follow the link bellow to see how the app perform](https://github.com/AhmedArnaout123/gifs/blob/main/heap%20sort/20201113_171247.gif)

Notes: 

1- The size of the nodes is responsive which means if you choose a tree with levels number less than 3 the size of the node will be bigger and if you choose a tree with levels number more than 3 the size of the node will be much smaller.

2- Althoug when you play with th tree levels the UI doesn't look so good but the challenge and the goal were to come with a responsive layout.

3- The animation looks slow here because of the gif file but the app runs well and the animation is smooth, you can check screen records bellow :
